TOWER
Render looking northeast toward the Bay### Page 5 Diamond Sponsor
5ARCHITECTURE ‚Äî NEW ICON
‚Ä¢Located by the San Francisco -
Oakland Bay Bridge
‚Ä¢Suspended  glass on steel frame + 
panelized double facade
‚Ä¢Looks to precedents  for inspiration  
but boldly carves its own place

6ARCHITECTURE ‚Äî FOG-CATCHER
‚Ä¢Fog-catching mesh system is 
located between the two towers, 
suspended  fromits four bridges
‚Ä¢Takes advantage  of fog to draw 
moisture from air and redistribute  
itas water throughout  building
‚Ä¢Collected  water has functional  
uses(e.g. irrigation,  cooling) and 
aesthetic  uses (e.g. reflection  
pools,indoor cascades)
Fine, mesh-like catchers suspended  
between each of the four bridges 
collect and condensate  moisture
Porous double-fa√ßade panels shade 
building but alsodouble as 
additional  meshes
Water travels downward  into 
reflection  pools and water tanksOn a beautiful  day in San Francisco,  
fog rolls in from the Bay...

7ARCHITECTURE ‚Äî PROGRAMMING
Commercial : to the north, against a major intersection . Series of adaptable, open-plan office 
spaces.Residential : to the south, tucked into a more private area. Mix of semi- and full-suite units with 
balconies .### Page 8 Diamond Sponsor
For retail, the tower mainly offers food-oriented programming  such as cafes, diners, bars, and automated  
vendors ‚Äî food-based services efficiently  transform  retail space into social space!

Geotechnical Considerations
9### Page 10 Diamond Sponsor
Basic Site Conditions
‚Ä¢Separation boundaries of North 
America tectonic plate and Pacific 
tectonic plate
‚Ä¢Major Faults
‚Ä¢San Andreas Fault
‚Ä¢Hayward -Rodgers Fault
‚Ä¢History
‚Ä¢Magnitude 7.9 Earthquake in 1906
10### Page 11 Diamond Sponsor
Regional Geology
‚Ä¢Soil Deposits: alluvial and fluvial deposits
‚Ä¢Marsh deposits/Young Bay mud
‚Ä¢Temescal formation
‚Ä¢San Antonio formation
‚Ä¢Alameda formations
‚Ä¢Main constituents of the soil based on the given boring log
‚Ä¢Very stiff to hard sandy clay and clay layers
‚Ä¢Loose to medium dense clayey sand layers
‚Ä¢Susceptible to Liquefaction 
‚Ä¢Clayey sand and sand with clay layers
‚Ä¢Young Bay mud
‚Ä¢Lateral spreading may happen at gently sloping regions
11### Page 12 Diamond Sponsor
Geotechnical Considerations
‚Ä¢Ground water table: 7.8 feet deep
‚Ä¢Low bearing capacity of soil layers
‚Ä¢Consolidation settlement is expected
‚Ä¢Pre-consolidation and/or dewatering are preferred
‚Ä¢Methods: vertical gravel drains/stone columns
‚Ä¢A deep pile foundation to very stiff and hard layers
‚Ä¢To bedrock if the digging depth is possible
‚Ä¢Site Class F without liquefaction mitigation
‚Ä¢Site Class E with liquefaction mitigation ( ‡¥•ùëÅ=10<15)

Structural System Design
13### Page 14 Diamond Sponsor
Objectives
‚Ä¢Protect skybridges
‚Ä¢Control relative displacement between towers
‚Ä¢Continuous load paths
‚Ä¢Target optimal period(s)
‚Ä¢Maximize FABI
‚Ä¢Ensure the tower is not sensitive to small change in period
14### Page 15 Diamond Sponsor
Structural Concepts
‚Ä¢Inner frames to provide continuous load 
paths and increase the stiffness of the 
tower
‚Ä¢Outer frames to provide redundancy in 
the structural system
‚Ä¢Continuous floor plans to resist torsion
‚Ä¢Optimized bracing scheme by gradually 
reduce the density of bracing

Dampers
16### Page 17 Diamond Sponsor
Inspiration
‚Ä¢Design was inspired by Michael 
Montgomery‚Äôs Fork Configuration 
Dampers (FCDs)
‚Ä¢FCDs at coupled wall provides significant 
effect on the dynamic response
‚Ä¢Viscoelastic damper acting in shear to 
add linear structural damping to a 
system
‚Ä¢Energy lost as heat
17
### Page 18 Diamond Sponsor
Viscoelastic Coupling Beam Damper
‚Ä¢Twin towers are configured similarly 
to coupled walls
‚Ä¢Towers will be more rigid than the 
dampers to allow energy transferred 
to dampers
‚Ä¢Flexible in shear and supportive in 
compression
‚Ä¢Damper Locations: 7th, 13th, 18th and 
19th skybridges‚Äô floors and roofs
‚Ä¢Large shear deformation at these locations
‚Ä¢Hide dampers in the structure

Calibration Process
‚Ä¢Free vibration (FV)  and sine sweep  tests  conducted
‚Ä¢Density of balsa wood calibrated to match tower weight
‚Ä¢Young‚Äôs Modulus of balsa wood calibrated to match tower 
natural period from FV
‚Ä¢E-W direction: T = 0.185s
‚Ä¢N-S direction: T = 0.170s
‚Ä¢Damping ratio of time history analysis calibrated to match 
damping ratio obtained from FV via log decrement
‚Ä¢E-W direction: Œ∂ = 6.5%
‚Ä¢N-S direction: Œ∂ = 5.0%
